*Submission is for the task you did in Mission 2, since Mission 1 was a "hello world" task for every team.*

## Team Information

**Team:** * team number 5, Footakagool, Karim Ziadi

**Summary:** *🚀 A brief description of your work 🚀*

This project, presents a mobile manipulation system designed to operate within common human environments, such as a tabletop or konbini counter. Our robot hardware leverages the robustness of open-source designs, specifically integrating components from the Lekiwi and XLerobot projects.

We trained the mobile arm for two distinct, challenging manipulation tasks, demonstrating both precise object relocation and high-dexterity grip control:

*** Object Relocation (Pick-and-Place): *** The robot executes a multi-step pick-and-place sequence. It picks up a bottle and then navigates to and places it inside a designated blue container. This task validates the robot's ability to perform reliable, multi-stage industrial-style object handling.

*** High-Dexterity Precision Grip: *** This model showcases advanced manipulation capability. Using a suction cup gripper, the robot is tasked with isolating and picking a single business card from a densely stacked box. This task is nearly impossible to perform reliably with conventional parallel grippers and demonstrates the effectiveness of our dexterity-focused training for handling thin, tightly packed objects.

## Code submission

This is the directory tree of this repo, you need to fill in the `mission` directory with your submission details.

```terminal
AMD_Robotics_Hackathon_2025_ProjectTemplate-main/
├── README.md
└── mission
    ├── code
    │   └── <code and script>
    └── wandb
        └── <latest run directory copied from wandb of your training job>
```


The `latest-run` is generated by wandb for your training job. Please copy it into the wandb sub directory of you Hackathon Repo.

The whole dir of `latest-run` will look like below:

```terminal

**NOTES**

1. The `latest-run` is the soft link, please make sure to copy the real target directory it linked with all sub dirs and files.
2. Only provide (upload) the wandb of your last success pre-trained model for the Mission.
